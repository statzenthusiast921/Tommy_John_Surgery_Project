# Tommy John Surgery Analysis

### Description

The goal of this project was to utilize historical pitching statistics coupled with data on Tommy John surgery (or ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) reconstruction surgery) patients to determine the impacts of this surgery on the career of a Major League pitcher.  The objectives of this analysis are listed out in the following bullets:

- Understand the frequency of the surgery over time for each professional level
- Analyze standard pitching statistics before vs. after the surgery to determine if performance improved or diminished as a result of the surgery
- Predict which pitchers are at the highest risk of needing the surgery in the next season (data was as of the 2019 season)
- Determine the success rate (defined as player returns) for several surgeons across professional level and position
- Analyze the length of time of recovery by position, level, team, and dominant arm
